# HomeLab

Welcome to my HomeLab repository, where I am collecting all things related to my HomeLab setup, like helper scripts, configuration etc.

## [TrueNAS SCALE Helper](https://github.com/kage-chan/HomeLab/tree/main/TNSH)
TrueNAS SCALE imho has a few edges and kinks I'm not too fond living with. Hogging up the complete system disk, k3s instead of docker or rather performance oriented power management are among them. To modify TrueNAS SCALE better to my liking, I've modified it a bit. I've made this script to document these modifications and to make things easier for others to maybe follow along.
